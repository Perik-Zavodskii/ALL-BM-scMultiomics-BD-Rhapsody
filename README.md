The role of Erythroid cells in immune regulation and immunosuppression is one of the emerging topics in modern immunology that still requires further clarification as Erythroid cells from different tissues and different species express different immunoregulatory molecules. In this study, we performed a thorough investigation of human bone marrow Erythroid cells from adult healthy donors and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients using the state-of-the-art single-cell targeted proteomics and transcriptomics via BD Rhapsody and cancer-related gene copy number variation analysis via NanoString Sprint Profiler. We found that human bone marrow Erythroid cells express the ARG1, LGALS1, LGALS3, LGALS9, and C10orf54 (VISTA) immunosuppressive genes, CXCL5, CXCL8, and VEGFA cytokine genes, as well as the genes involved in antimicrobial immunity and MHC Class II antigen presentation. We also found that ARG1 gene expression was restricted to the single erythroid cell cluster that we termed ARG1-positive Orthochromatic erythroblasts and that late Erythroid cells lose S100A9 and gain MZB1 gene expression in case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. These findings show that steady-state erythropoiesis bone marrow Erythroid cells express myeloid signature genes even without any transdifferentiating stimulus like cancer.
